# ShopPulse: Tracking Trends in Online Purchase Intent  
*Tracking what people buy, when they buy it, and occasionally wondering... why?*

---

## **Overview**

This project dives deep into the intriguing world of online shopper behavior. Using real-world data, it identifies trends, patterns, and key factors driving consumer purchase decisions. The analysis was done using **Python for data preparation and exploration**, and **Power BI for interactive dashboarding** — because numbers mean more when they look pretty.

---

## **Project Objectives**

- Clean and preprocess online shopping data  
- Extract and visualize insights from customer behavior  
- Analyze seasonal and category-wise purchase trends  
- Provide business-oriented recommendations  
- Deliver it with just enough sarcasm to stay sane

---

## **Tech Stack**

- **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) — for the heavy lifting  
- **Power BI** — for the “wow, that looks professional” effect  
- **Jupyter Notebook** — where all the messy magic happened  
- **CSV** — because nothing screams “data” like a flat file

---

## **Key Insights**

- **Q4 Sales Surge**: Nothing like Diwali, Christmas, and New Year to remind people of their hidden shopaholic alter-egos.  
- **Electronics Peak in March**: Apparently, March is when students and adults both agree to upgrade their gadgets — productivity or procrastination, we’ll never know.  
- **Books & Stationery Spike in June**: Schools reopen, parents panic, and Amazon becomes their new best friend.

## **Dashboards: What's Inside Power BI?**

- **Monthly Sales Trends**  
- **Top Categories by Orders and Revenue**  
- **Payment Method Analysis**  
- **Customer Demographics**  
- **Order Status Distribution**  
- **RFM Segmentation** — because some customers *really* love shopping

## **Getting Started**

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`exploratory_analysis.ipynb`)  
3. Open the Power BI dashboard  
4. Pretend like you didn’t spend half the time fixing datetime formats

## **Why No ML?**

This project focuses on **exploratory analysis** and **business insights**, not predictive modeling.  
Let’s be honest — sometimes it's better to understand your data than blindly throw it into a model and hope for the best.
